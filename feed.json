It is a nice little setup; I love it for blogging and syndicated tweets/toots. But their built-in podcasting feature was too basic for what I had in mind. Then I tried one of the podcast hosts, which I found to be restrictive, with little wiggle room. At that point, I went dyi, set up a webserver, wrote my own HTML and CSS, got a CDN, and rolled that way. Which worked fairly well, though it was a lot of work. My podcast <a href=\"https://noexpectations.show\">No Expectations</a> will continue that way. But I needed something more complete.</p>\n<p>I looked at static site generators, WordPress, more podcast hosting platforms, and multiple other little apps and services.

Once the color change is done, all I need is a logo which I&rsquo;m trying to make happen soon.</p>\n<p>Next, to lay things out how I want, I need a couple of plugins. First is the &lsquo;Reply by Email&rsquo; plugin, and I needed the &lsquo;Custom home page&rsquo; plugin. Reply by email gives me the first form of communication with the audience, placing an easy link to send in feedback with the episode name as a subject.
